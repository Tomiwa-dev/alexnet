#ALEXNET IMPLEMENTATION

This is an implementation of AlexNet, from the research paper "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional
Neural Networks" by Alex Krizhevsky et al https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf

I attempt to implement the network with Pytorch and TensorFlow. 

##Prerequisites

Python 
Pytorch
TensorFlow

Detailed requirements.txt files are included for each framework.

##DATASET

I used the Caltech_101 dataset for this implementation due to the size of the ImageNet dataset used in the original paper.
